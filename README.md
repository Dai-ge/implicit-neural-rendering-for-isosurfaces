# implicit-neural-rendering-for-isosurfaces
This is a Pytorch implementation for our project "Implicit Neural Rendering For Isosurfaces".

# Short Summary
This project aims to develop a fully convolutional neural network with [Siren](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09661) activation function to render isosurfaces with three groups of parameters, including image resolution, (two) viewpoints and isovalue.

# Pre-requisites
1. Windows/Linux
